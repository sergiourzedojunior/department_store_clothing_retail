In this file you will find hypothetical data for a retailer from 2023 and 2022 (January to September). In the green tabs you'll find 4 small databases, which contain the raw transaction data and the product, store and customer dimensions.

Instructions:

Using Pandas and Numpy (or if you prefer, other Python libraries) you should clean and process the data following the steps below, assuming that your code should work not only for this small base, but for a base of 237 Million transactions, 640 thousand products, 1021 Stores and 21 Million customers. In other words, do the analysis using Python, in the most efficient and optimized way you can, considering that this is the type of study we usually do with a large volume of data and on a recurring basis. Please send the notebook (.ipynb) by e-mail before the presentation.

0. Import the data from the green tabs of the Excel file.

1. clean and prepare the data
 - Eliminating possible spaces at the beginning and end of each column in the different tables

2. Bring in the main KPIs that summarize the base's behaviour: spend per customer, items purchased, frequency, etc. You can show them in graphs and provide the averages and distribution of the values. It is important that you write in your own words a conclusion about what can be observed in the graphs.

3. In the year 2023 the campaigns focused on selling the red top brand "Gamma Z". Please assess whether these products performed better

"4. The fashion and marketing teams are introducing a new product recommendation system for email blasts. In order to verify the efficiency of this new model, a test was carried out in which customers were separated into two groups:
CONTROL - Received the email with the OLD recommendation system
TEST - Received the e-mail with the NEW recommendation system

Looking at the results in the Test tab, answer the fashion and marketing teams whether the NEW system has a significant difference to the OLD model.
